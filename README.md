### MicroLEDs Research Paper 🥼
*MicroLEDs they require 90% less power input than LCDs do and can potentially enable the use of Li-fi. I wrote a research article about them under the mentorship of Dr. Sudhiranjan Tripathy at A*STAR*

This article is a research review of <span style="color:green">microscopic Gallium Nitride-based LEDs</span> since their first demonstration in 2000 and a proposal of the use of <span style="color:green">silicon</span>-substrate type microLEDs, which may increase the market readiness of the technology. The article examines other inventions, namely the vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser and Quantum Dots, and merges the prototypes together to propose a completely new <span style="color:green">‘super micro-cavity’ design</span>.

### Ferrofluids Experiment 👩‍🔬
*Ferrofluids are are a type of nanofluids made of superparamagnetic nanoparticles. I conducted an experiment about them for my IB Physics Extended Essay.*

My overheating headphones were always a buzzkill while listening to Spotify. As I researched into better alternatives to the conventional coolants used in my terrible headphones, I came across ferrofluids. Mesmerized by the geometric spikes it forms under a magnetic field and the strange nature of its inter-particle behavior, I began testing its suitability as a <span style="color:green">heat transfer fluid</span>. 

Due to material constraints, I had to build the experimental apparatus from scratch - creating a <span style="color:green">variable magnetic field</span> without an electromagnet and making my own thermal conductivity measurement instrument with <span style="color:green">copper tubing and an acrylic box</span>. As an experimenter, I am always tinkering to come up with new ways to test my whacky hypotheses.

### Gravitational Waves Modelling 🔭
*Gravitational waves are disturbances or ‘ripples’ in space-time. They originate from massive accelerating masses such as binary black holes or neutron stars and travel at the speed of light. This was our team's final project for Physics 2600.*

The first gravitational waves were detected by LIGO in 2015 and was a momentous discovery for the science community. This detection was a result of a <span style="color:green">binary black hole merger</span>, an event dubbed GW150914. As time went on, two other types of binary mergers were detected. The first <span style="color:green">binary neutron star merger</span>, GW170817, was detected by LIGO in 2017, and the <span style="color:green">first binary black hole - neutron star merger</span>, GW200105, was detected by LIGO in 2020. 

The <span style="color:green">motion</span> of these gravitational waves collision events were modeled and their <span style="color:green">timescales</span> of collisions are compared. More information and simulation results are included in the poster. I worked on this project with Shivani Nellore.

### Asteroid Orbit Modelling ☄️
*Asteroids whose distance of closest approach to the Earth is lesser than 1.3 Astronomical Units (or 1.95×10** m) are known as Near-Earth Asteroids. I modelled their behaviour for my IB Math Internal Assessement.*

In 2020, my friends and I were worried as NASA detected five asteroids that were heading towards the Earth. Although they didn't land, they were able to get so close without detection due to limited information about them. 

I attempted to solve the problem of how can one determine the distance between a Near Earth Asteroid and the Sun with angular measurements of right ascension and declination only. Using the geometry of sectors, as well as <span style="color:green">cross and dot product, I outlined a concise derivation of <span style="color:green">Gauss’s method of Orbit Determination</span>. Subsequently, I applied the method to primary data and determine the distance of Asteroid CX1 from the Sun in mid-October 2020. Following this, I derived <span style="color:green">Lagrange’s f and g series</span> through a <span style="color:green">McLaurin Expansion</span> to make the method more precise and understand the limitations of Gauss’s Method.
