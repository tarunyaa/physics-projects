### Gravitational Waves Modelling 🔭
*Gravitational waves are disturbances or ‘ripples’ in space-time. They originate from massive accelerating masses such as binary black holes or neutron stars and travel at the speed of light.*

The Motion of different gravitational waves collision events are modeled and their timescales of collisions are compared. More information and simulation results are included in the poster. I worked on this project with Shivani Nellore.
