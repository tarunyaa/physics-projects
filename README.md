## Physics Projects

### MicroLEDs Research Paper 🥼
* MicroLEDs are inherently useful: they require 90% less power input than LCDs do and can potentially enable the use of Li-fi (Light-based WiFi). However, despite these prospective applications, MicroLEDs are not yet commercially feasible, due to the high expense of the sapphire substrate.*

I wrote a paper reviewing literature on microLEDs in the field and proposing the future direction of micro-LEDs, the ‘super micro-cavity’ design, where silicon substrate increase market readiness, under the mentorship of Professor Sudhirajan Tripathy at A*STAR

### Gravitational Waves Modelling 🔭
*Gravitational waves are disturbances or ‘ripples’ in space-time. They originate from massive accelerating masses such as binary black holes or neutron stars and travel at the speed of light.*

The motion of different gravitational waves collision events are modeled and their timescales of collisions are compared. More information and simulation results are included in the poster. I worked on this project with Shivani Nellore.
