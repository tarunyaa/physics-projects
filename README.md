### MicroLEDs Research Paper 🥼
*MicroLEDs are inherently useful: they require 90% less power input than LCDs do and can potentially enable the use of Li-fi (Light-based WiFi). However, despite these prospective applications, MicroLEDs are not yet commercially feasible, due to the high expense of the sapphire substrate. A solution was suggested under the mentorship of Professor Sudhirajan Tripathy at A*STAR.*

I wrote an article which is a research review of microscopic Gallium Nitride-based LEDs since their first demonstration in 2000 and a proposal of the use of silicon-substrate type microLEDs, which may increase the market readiness of the technology. The choice of silicon as a substrate, rather than the staple sapphire, would require amendments to the original microLED design. Hence, the article examines other inventions, namely the vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser and Quantum Dots, and merges the prototypes together to propose a completely new ‘super micro-cavity’ design.

### Ferrofluids Experiment 👩‍🔬
*Ferrofluids are proposed to be ‘enhanced’ heat transfer fluids by virtue of the variability of its physical properties under an external magnetic field.*

The relationship between external magnetic field strength and thermal conductivity was studied through a modified transient-hot wire method. Ferrofluid was kept in a custom acrylic box, a heat source was placed in the middle and magnetic field was varied using Nd magnets. Temperature rise of the ferrofluid at the edges of the box was measured over time, using a temperature probe. Thermal conductivity was then calculated.

### Gravitational Waves Modelling 🔭
*Gravitational waves are disturbances or ‘ripples’ in space-time. They originate from massive accelerating masses such as binary black holes or neutron stars and travel at the speed of light.*

The first Gravitational waves were detected by LIGO in 2015. This detection was a result of a binary black hole merger, an event dubbed GW150914. As time went on, two other types of binary mergers were detected. The first binary neutron star merger, GW170817, was detected by LIGO in 2017, and the first binary black hole - neutron star merger, GW200105, was detected by LIGO in 2020. The motion of these gravitational waves collision events were modeled and their timescales of collisions are compared. More information and simulation results are included in the poster. I worked on this project with Shivani Nellore.

### Asteroid Orbit Modelling ☄️
*Asteroids whose distance of closest approach to the Earth is lesser than 1.3 Astronomical Units (or 1.95×10** m) are known as Near-Earth Asteroids.*

Earlier last year, my friends and I were worried as NASA detected five asteroids that were heading towards the Earth, one of them being Asteroid 2020 CX1 (Monzon 2020). Although they missed the Earth, the problem arises of how can one determine the distance between a Near Earth
Asteroid and the Sun with limited information as we usually have, with just angular measurements of right ascension and declination only. Using the geometry of sectors, as well as cross and dot product, I outlined a concise derivation of Gauss’s method of Orbit Determination. Subsequently, I applied the method to primary data and determine the distance of Asteroid CX1 from the Sun in mid-October 2020. Following this, I derived Lagrange’s f and g series through a McLaurin Expansion to make the method more precise and understand the limitations of Gauss’s Method.
